# Hi, I'm Anand Ramakrishnan 👋

**AI Product & Engineering Executive** | Building production AI systems since 2012

I build AI-powered platforms that generate revenue—not demos. From neuroevolution-based trading systems to multi-agent LLM orchestration, I've shipped AI products where failure costs real money.

## 🔧 What I Build

### Multi-Agent Systems & LLM Orchestration
Currently focused on **evaluator-optimizer patterns** for production LLM systems—where orchestrator agents delegate to specialized generators, and evaluator agents adversarially score output until convergence. This approach reduced hallucination rates from ~15% to <2% in enterprise deployments.

### Applied AI & Optimization
- **ML Bid Optimization**: Time-series demand prediction + dynamic pricing achieving 50%+ margins
- **Identity Graphs**: Probabilistic entity resolution at 500M+ profile scale
- **RL-Based Systems**: Contextual bandits, Thompson sampling for explore-exploit optimization

### Production AI Experience
- **2023-Present**: Agentic AI, multi-agent orchestration, RAG pipelines
- **2012-2019**: Neural architecture search (NEAT-inspired neuroevolution), custom CUDA kernels, Deep RL for trading
- Built production ML before TensorFlow existed

## 📊 By the Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Products built 0→1 | $150M+ ARR in 18 months |
| Portfolio managed | $500M+ |
| Teams led | 300+ engineers |
| Acquisitions integrated | 4 |

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### [multi-agent-evaluator-orchestrator](https://github.com/anandoiyer9/multi-agent-evaluator-orchestrator)
Production-grade framework for building multi-agent LLM systems using the evaluator-optimizer pattern. Models are better critics than generators—separate generation from evaluation and iterate to convergence.
